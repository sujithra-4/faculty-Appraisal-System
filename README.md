Faculty Appraisal System
Overview

The Faculty Appraisal System is a web-based application designed to automate and improve the faculty evaluation process in educational institutions. Traditional manual appraisal methods are time-consuming and often lack transparency. This system provides a secure, data-driven, and role-based solution to evaluate faculty performance fairly and efficiently.

The application is developed using the LAMP stack with Python for data analytics.
